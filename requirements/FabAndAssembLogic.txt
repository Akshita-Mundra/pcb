For Fabrication we need:

1.       Gerber/ODB++ ipc2581 . ipc356 netlist 

2.       Drill layers (this can be on Gerber, Excellon ASCII or Excellon EIA). Prefer is Exellon ASCII

3.       Fab Drawings (this can be on Gerber, DXF, DWG, PDF).

4.       Layer Sequence ( this can be, readme, Fab Drawing, Gerber Header)

5.       ODB++ (This could contain all the above)

Layer count. 


 

For Assembly we need:

1.       All of the above

2.       BOM excel format 

3.       Assembly Drawings (this can be ODB++, gerber, PDF, DXF, DWG)

4.       Paste Layers (this can be gerber or ODB++)

5.       X&Y


------ ODB
Layer types signal, mixed or power_ground and the context is board. 
These will be the copper layers. 
By looking at the row number you can calculate the layer sequence and layer count.

-Other layer types with context board will define mask, silk, paste and drill layers.

-Layer types with context misc will most likely be the drawing and the name may define what type of drawing.

-Layers types called component maybe used as assembly drawings.

Assembly Logic:

1.       BOM. For the most part they are excel format. In some cases they are PDF. You can Identify this by file name and parsing or OCR and 
look for the following key words: ITEM|SN|MANUF|MPN|PARTNUM|MANFPART|MFG|MANFP|MFRP|MFGR|MP#|VENDOR|VPN|DISTRIBUTOR|DPN|DIGIKEY|DISTRIBUTOR_P|
QUANTITY|REFERENCE|DESIGNATOR|REFDES|SCHEMATIC|DONOTINSTALL|DNI|DNP|DONOTPOPULATE|STUFF|DESC|LIBREF|PARTDESCRIPTION

2.       Assembly drawings. This is going to be the same as Fab drawing, but different keywords like assem.

3.       Paste Layers. This can be found thru the FAB logic. 

4.       X&Y. Iâ€™m not very familiar with this, I believe they can be ASCII files or excel. 
I do not believe that there is a standard format for this. 
Somebody in assembly will have to give more input.
