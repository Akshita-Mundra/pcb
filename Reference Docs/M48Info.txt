Between M48 and % or M95 There are header information that we are interested in
; - Line starting with ";" is a comment.
We need to separate TYPE "plated" and "non-plated" info in group.
We also need to know the format- which is the number format and the unit of measurement.

Example of a Header
Below is a sample of a header. The PURPOSE shown to the right of the COMMAND 
is not part of the command, but is shown for your benefit to explain the command:

COMMAND 		| PURPOSE 
 M48 			| The beginning of a header 
INCH,LZ 		| Use the inch measuring system with leading zeros 
VER,1 			| Use Version 1 X and Y axis layout 
FMAT,2 			| Use Format 2 commands 
1/2/3 			| Link tools 1, 2, and 3 
T1C.04F200S65 	| Set Tool 1 for 0.040" with infeed rate of 200 inch/min Speed of 65,000 RPM 
DETECT,ON 		| Detect broken tools 
M95 or % 		| End of the header
